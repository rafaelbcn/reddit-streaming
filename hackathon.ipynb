Apparently boho is back on the runways and possible poised to come back mainstream. It calls back to the early 2000s and the 70s as well, especially with 70s being in style right now. It reminds me of the Vietnam protests and the 60s-70s boho fashion. And now we have the protests against Israel. \\n\\nI don’t think boho fashion ever really left us, Free People has continued to be fashionable and Target sells their Knox Rose line which is supposed to be their “version” of Free People and Anthropologie. \\n\\nI personally can see boho fashion making a come back, especially with the current popular tiered flowy skirts. I think it’ll be mixed with Coquette, reminding me of Shabby Chic, since LoveShackFancy is popular. \\n\\nI’ve personally been looking into more boho looks myself, but more of a neutral color look mixed with coastal granddaughter and coquette.

', 'created_utc': 1716908379.0, 'text': 'Last weekend, I found myself wearing an outfit I really didn’t like, and it soured my mood all afternoon. What happened was that we planned to go on a hike in the morning, when it would be foggy and cold. I wore a plain long sleeved black shirt, straight leg jeans, and running shoes. None of the components were awful, but it was a very function-over-form outfit. After the hike, we decided on an impromptu lunch in the cutesy town nearby, and I felt so out of place. Most of the women were dressed in a very intentional way- not formal or necessarily trendy, but their outfits all looked carefully selected for a nice lunch on a spring day. I felt super frumpy! My hiking outfit wasn’t outdoorsy enough to communicate “this is my personal style” - it just felt uncool.\\n\\nI tried to look a bit more put-together by tucking in my shirt and wearing my sunglasses and baseball cap.

Apparently boho is back on the runways and possible poised to come back mainstream. It calls back to the early 2000s and the 70s as well, especially with 70s being in style right now. It reminds me of the Vietnam protests and the 60s-70s boho fashion. And now we have the protests against Israel. \\n\\nI don’t think boho fashion ever really left us, Free People has continued to be fashionable and Target sells their Knox Rose line which is supposed to be their “version” of Free People and Anthropologie. \\n\\nI personally can see boho fashion making a come back, especially with the current popular tiered flowy skirts. I think it’ll be mixed with Coquette, reminding me of Shabby Chic, since LoveShackFancy is popular. \\n\\nI’ve personally been looking into more boho looks myself, but more of a neutral color look mixed with coastal granddaughter and coquette.

', 'created_utc': 1716908379.0, 'text': 'Last weekend, I found myself wearing an outfit I really didn’t like, and it soured my mood all afternoon. What happened was that we planned to go on a hike in the morning, when it would be foggy and cold. I wore a plain long sleeved black shirt, straight leg jeans, and running shoes. None of the components were awful, but it was a very function-over-form outfit. After the hike, we decided on an impromptu lunch in the cutesy town nearby, and I felt so out of place. Most of the women were dressed in a very intentional way- not formal or necessarily trendy, but their outfits all looked carefully selected for a nice lunch on a spring day. I felt super frumpy! My hiking outfit wasn’t outdoorsy enough to communicate “this is my personal style” - it just felt uncool.\\n\\nI tried to look a bit more put-together by tucking in my shirt and wearing my sunglasses and baseball cap. Those were really all the fashion tools I had at my disposal, so I’m not sure how successful I was. So, geniuses of FFA, what tips and tricks do you have for adding a little pizzazz to an outfit at the last minute? \\n\\nExample scenarios: you’re running errands in sloppy clothes and your friend invites you to lunch; you’re at work and you get invited to happy hour at a trendy spot.

Apparently boho is back on the runways and possible poised to come back mainstream. It calls back to the early 2000s and the 70s as well, especially with 70s being in style right now. It reminds me of the Vietnam protests and the 60s-70s boho fashion. And now we have the protests against Israel. \\n\\nI don’t think boho fashion ever really left us, Free People has continued to be fashionable and Target sells their Knox Rose line which is supposed to be their “version” of Free People and Anthropologie. \\n\\nI personally can see boho fashion making a come back, especially with the current popular tiered flowy skirts. I think it’ll be mixed with Coquette, reminding me of Shabby Chic, since LoveShackFancy is popular. \\n\\nI’ve personally been looking into more boho looks myself, but more of a neutral color look mixed with coastal granddaughter and coquette. Looks that are kinda like Mori Kei from prior Japanese fashion. '}\n",

      "{'title': 'How do you zhuzh up a frumpy outfit in a pinch? ', 'created_utc': 1716908379.0, 'text': 'Last weekend, I found myself wearing an outfit I really didn’t like, and it soured my mood all afternoon. What happened was that we planned to go on a hike in the morning, when it would be foggy and cold. I wore a plain long sleeved black shirt, straight leg jeans, and running shoes. None of the components were awful, but it was a very function-over-form outfit. After the hike, we decided on an impromptu lunch in the cutesy town nearby, and I felt so out of place. Most of the women were dressed in a very intentional way- not formal or necessarily trendy, but their outfits all looked carefully selected for a nice lunch on a spring day. I felt super frumpy! My hiking outfit wasn’t outdoorsy enough to communicate “this is my personal style” - it just felt uncool.\\n\\nI tried to look a bit more put-together by tucking in my shirt and wearing my sunglasses and baseball cap. Those were really all the fashion tools I had at my disposal, so I’m not sure how successful I was. So, geniuses of FFA, what tips and tricks do you have for adding a little pizzazz to an outfit at the last minute? \\n\\nExample scenarios: you’re running errands in sloppy clothes and your friend invites you to lunch; you’re at work and you get invited to happy hour at a trendy spot. Do you keep certain accessories or clothing items, say, in your car or work desk? Do you have hair styles that quickly elevate a look? Other styling tips and tricks that take an outfit from “blah” to “she tried”?'}\n"

Apparently boho is back on the runways and possible poised to come back mainstream. It calls back to the early 2000s and the 70s as well, especially with 70s being in style right now. It reminds me of the Vietnam protests and the 60s-70s boho fashion. And now we have the protests against Israel. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t think boho fashion ever really left us, Free People has continued to be fashionable and Target sells their Knox Rose line which is supposed to be their \\u201cversion\\u201d of Free People and Anthropologie. \\n\\nI personally can see boho fashion making a come back, especially with the current popular tiered flowy skirts.

None of the components were awful, but it was a very function-over-form outfit. After the hike, we decided on an impromptu lunch in the cutesy town nearby, and I felt so out of place. Most of the women were dressed in a very intentional way- not formal or necessarily trendy, but their outfits all looked carefully selected for a nice lunch on a spring day. I felt super frumpy!
